CodeAlpha_Disease-Prediction-from-Medical-Data
Created a model to predict the likelihood of a disease based on medical data (e.g., symptoms, patient history). Used datasets with labeled medical records and apply classification algorithms.

I will be using datasets of 3 very common diseases those are,
1) Diabetes
2) Heart Disease
3) Parkinson's Disease

I will be using Support Vector Machine (SVM) model due to its high accuracy prediction even for non-numeric datatype.

The accuracy of the prediction model for each disease is,
1) Diabetes - 77.27%
2) Heart Disease - 81.96%
3) Parkinson's Disease - 87.17%

The required library versions to run the app correctly are,
numpy==1.26.3,
scikit-learn==1.3.2,
